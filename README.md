# Introduction
This program is done by Art Nela and me.
We took a collage project, to create an online shopping platform with C#, .Net in Windows Form.
We knew nothing except writing "Hello World" on the console. No idea how GitHub worked for a join project.
A special thanks go to the professors that motivated us to do this: **Ermira Daka & Annea Futko**.
This project went to push us to start our start-up in Kosovo: **LUA Robotics**, the first robotics company in our country.

# Target group
People that live in the rural region, with poor road connections to the pharmacies.

# The project brief
The user needs to register first, and the user data will be stored in a local database that VC Community provides.
After the sign-up, the user could purchase pills that are available on the platform (mostly pills to help with COVID-19).
After the user would add to cart the pills, the user will go to the buy form, which would tell the user the total and required the user's address and email.
The user address would be stored in the platform database and the Drone (autonomous package delivery) would get access so it can go and ship the pills.
The user would be notified by email for each step of the delivery process, also in the email, the user would find a QR Code that would open the Drone storage and a pdf instruction for the pills.
And the final feature that we had in our platform was the AI Algorithm that would suggest what pills you need, based on the symptoms that the user put in the form.
It was a beta platform that was presented in front of the class.
The final project was documented and contained UML and Class diagrams, User stories, and feedback from beta users (our friends & colleagues) and an Infectiologist that help us with the symptoms.
